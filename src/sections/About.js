        <p>
          Well, Iâ€™ve been working on web app development for two years now,
          while still studying at college. Having my own projects, coded mostly
          in Node JS and React JS, I have learned a lot while working on these
          projects. Now I am looking to get an internship to get some
          experience, and am glad to be interviewing with you here.
        </p>
        <div className="mt-4">
          <p>
            These are some qualities that I think sets me apart from other
            candidates
          </p>
          <p className="flex">
            <FaCheckCircle className="text-sky-600 text-4xl" /> One of the
            things that distinguish me from other candidates is that I am able
            to remain calm and focused no matter how difficult the task. I
            always try to stay positive and find a way out. I am sure that
            everything happens for a reason and that any mistake can be fixed.
          </p>
